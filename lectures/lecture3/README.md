# Geometric Jacobian (2-DoF arm)

In the Jupyter file browser running inside the container, open `geometric_jacobian_2dofs_arm.ipynb`
and run all cells.

# Gradient descent (2-DoF arm) and inverse vs gradient descent
In the Jupyter file browser running inside the container, open `gradient_descent_2dofs_arm.ipynb`
and `inverse_vs_gradient_descent.ipynb`, then run all cells.

The scripts plot all data available, so consider removing generated files between runs:

```bash
rm *.csv *.png *.gif
```
